-Login/Register

-create a game
-join a game
-customize number of different roles in a given game (but have defaults based on the number of players)
-randomize roles for players and show them helpful information about their role
-send assigned roles to players so they can see it on their phone
-give moderator/admin a list of players with their roles
-allow turn-by-turn entry from moderator on what has happened (who got killed at night, who got killed during the day, who the seer checked, etc
-store each turn's information in a database linked to the current game, so that per-turn statistics are possible (like what average turn a player dies on)
-store each game's overall data in a database so overall winrates etc are viewable as statistics
-store each player's individual data from each game in a database so they can view their own stats and leaderboards are possible
-implement a leaderboard showing the players with the highest winrates or other metrics (highest loss rate?  fastest deathrate?  longest average lifespan?)
-implement data visualization for things like average winrates for the two teams over time, so users can visualize how the winrates of the villagers/werewolves have changed over the past couple dozen times they have played
-implement python channels to keep users' phones listening for new information to update when they have been killed in-game, etc
-maybe have a page for each game in the database history so you can view information about how that game went, and then -be able to leave comments on individual games so you can talk about crazy stuff that happened?
-have a profile page for users that shows their stats etc and allows users to leave comments?
