Feature List ideas

P0
-Login/Register
    -Basic Validations
-create a game
-join a game
-have default numbers of roles in a given game based on the number of players
-randomize roles for players and show them helpful information about their role
-send assigned roles to players so they can see it on their phone
-store each game's overall data in a database so overall winrates etc are viewable as statistics
-show list of players that are in a given game as well as their current status (dead/alive)

P1
-allow host to customize number of different roles in a given game
-give moderator/admin a list of players with their roles
-store each game's overall data in a database so overall winrates etc are viewable as statistics
-store each player's individual data from each game in a database so they can view their own stats and leaderboards are possible
-implement a leaderboard showing the players with the highest winrates or other metrics (highest loss rate?  fastest deathrate?  longest average lifespan?)
-Allow players to reconnect to existing game only if they are currently on the game's list of players

P2
-allow turn-by-turn entry from moderator on what has happened (who got killed at night, who got killed during the day, who the seer checked, etc
    -store each turn's information in a database linked to the current game, so that per-turn statistics are possible (like what average turn a player dies on)
-implement data visualization for things like average winrates for the two teams over time, so users can visualize how the winrates of the villagers/werewolves have changed over the past couple dozen times they have played
-maybe have a page for each game in the database history so you can view information about how that game went, and then -be able to leave comments on individual games so you can talk about crazy stuff that happened?
-have a profile page for users that shows their stats etc and allows users to leave comments?
-Implement ability for player to join a game that has already started if approved by moderator (with manual role assignment) to account for issues where a player has disconnected or an error happens? or maybe just:
-Spectator mode for bystanders to "join" a game and be able to see a player list with roles?
-Allow moderator to kick players from game either in host-game lobby or during game to deal with troublemakers or people that have to leave mid-game
-Allow moderator/host to manually 'kill' players (set to dead) in case of weird situations the game can't account for
-Make header stay at top of screen even when scrolling down, such as in /home/ page
-Modularize the header so it is a partial html that is loaded on each page

P3
-Email verification (?)
    -Forgot my password (?)
-implement python channels to keep users' phones listening for new information to update when they have been killed in-game, etc
-Use python channels or implement a small ajax refresh button to refresh current list of active games
