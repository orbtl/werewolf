-Header loading a split second after the rest of the page.  Can we make it load first?
-game options need to show their current values to non-host players on game lobby
-make function for populating game with fake players for debugging/demonstration purposes
-game settings page for players shows correct settings but we need to fix it showing True/False instead of maybe 1 or 0 (or maybe show greyed out checkboxes???)
