-Header loading a split second after the rest of the page.  Can we make it load first?
-game settings page for players shows correct settings but we need to fix it showing True/False instead of maybe 1 or 0 (or maybe show greyed out checkboxes???)
-spectators can't see roles of players
-Need to implement lovers seeing who else is their lover once chosen by cupid
-Add name property to game model and implement showing the name for game differentiation
-check defender to make sure primary ammo role id check is working
-show secondary roles in player list
-program witch functionality (killing someone)
-actually get post-game page to show information about the game
-accursed one needs to have only 1 ammo (check all special characters too)
-never actually set lovers to secondary_role_name even though logic to check for them is there
